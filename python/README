You may need to edit your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the OpenCV and Sibyl
libraries.

For example, if your development is in ~/dev, and you are on 64-bit Linux, you
would use:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/dev/sibyl/build/modules/core:~/dev/sibyl/build/modules/money:~/dev/libs/opencv/current/linux-x86_64/lib"

Add this to your .bashrc to make things easier.
